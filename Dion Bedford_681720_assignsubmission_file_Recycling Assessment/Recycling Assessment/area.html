                  <br>
                  <p>Dunedin's rubbish collection is a user pays system. This is fairer for everyone as you only pay for what you throw out.<br>
                  The DCC rubbish bag price includes collection, disposal and ETS contributions. This is combined with a kerbside recycling collection.</p>
                  <p>Note: Collection days vary by address.</p>
                  <ul>
                  <li class="norm-list">Utilise DCC authorised rubbish bags from the DCC Service Centres and other outlets.</li>
                  <li class="norm-list">Put your recycling in your blue bin for glass or your wheelie bin for paper, rigid plastics packaging, cardboard, paper, aluminium and steel tins and cans.</li>
                  <li class="norm-list">Place either the blue bin or the yellow lidded bin at the kerbside by 7am on collection day and not before 7pm the night before. Which bin will depend on the collection fortnight.</li>
                  <li class="norm-list">Put it out on the footpath close to the kerb edge. Keep the footpath clear for pedestrians.</li>
                  <li class="norm-list">Collection begins at 7am and can continue until 7pm on your collection day.</li>
                  <li class="norm-list">If your rubbish/recycling is not collected, please contact us.</li>

                  <h4>Recycling - what you need to know</h4>
                  <p>At present kerbside glass collected in the Wakatipu is not recycled and is sent to the landfill. The issue with the kerbside glass collection in Wakatipu is that the glass colours are all mixed together and also mixed with other recyclables.  This glass is separated out at the Wakatipu Recycling Centre, but as it is contaminated by other recyclables and not colour sorted, it is of low value and unable to be sold.  As the glass is inert it assists as a face stabiliser at the landfill and prevents the need to import other materials for this purpose. Previously it was being crushed and used as a roading aggregate. This is different to the glass collected kerbside in the Wanaka Ward which is colour sorted at the kerb allowing it to be sold in Auckland who turn it back into glass bottles.
                  A new kerbside collection service for glass will commence district wide in July 2019. This means the glass material will be clean and uncontaminated (not mixed with other materials) and will not be sent to landfill. What we end up doing with the glass material is yet to be decided.

                  <p>Mt Cooee accepts general waste, special waste, green waste and recyclables. Conditions do apply e.g. recyclables and greenwaste must be of accepted types only and special waste must be accompanied with a permit issued by Council.</p>
                  
                  <p>Approved greenwaste includes lawn clippings, hedge clippings, leaves, tree trimmings with branches less than 150mm diameter, and garden weeds. Small amounts of soil associated with plant roots etc, is acceptable.<br>                
                  Accepted recyclables include rigid plastic containers (number 1-7), paper, flattened cardboard, aluminium tins and steel cans (Mixed).<br>
                  Glass bottles and jars (separate from other recyclables) are accepted for reuse only; these are crushed and used for roading and drainage throughout the landfill.​<br>
                  Greenwaste and recyclables that do not meet these criteria will be treated as general waste.<br>
                  Large quantities of clean fill are not accepted and special wastes (difficult or hazardous) are accepted only with a Special Waste Permit.<br>
                  If you can recycle it in your yellow bin, then you can recycle it at Mt Cooee. That includes clean, rigid plastic containers, paper and cardboard, clean aluminium, steel cans and tins. These recyclables can be mixed.​</p>
