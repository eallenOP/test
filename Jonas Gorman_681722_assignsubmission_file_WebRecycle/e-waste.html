				<h3> What is e-Waste?</h3>
				<p> e-Waste is the fastest growing waste stream in developed countries. It is made up of electronic equipment that has come to the end of its useful life and is destined for disposal. It includes for example: televisions, computers, cell phones, photocopiers, printers, stereos, DVD and VCR players, cameras and batteries.</p>

				<h3> Where to go with your e-Waste</h3>
				<p>There are e-Waste collection facilities at the Green Island Resource Recovery Centre for computer waste, TVs, cell phones and other electronic waste items.  A small recycling charge may apply to some items to cover the costs of dismantling and/or special handling. Items collected here are dismantled by Cargill Enterprises in South Dunedin.</p>

				<h3> How can I support e-Waste recycling?</h3>
				<p>When you buy a new electronic device, ask the supplier if they will take your old electronic device for recycling. Some distributors are starting to realise this is an add-on service they can offer customers.
					Consumers can create the demand for recycling through their purchasing decisions, and place the responsibility for recycling on the producers where it belongs.
