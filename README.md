# My first git repo

I am learning about git, vim and markdown.

This is my second bit of work on my project.

Adding another line to a staged file to see what happens.

[Github link](http://github.com) this is a link. It will be clickable when I push it to Github.

I'm adding this line in the GitHub editor.
