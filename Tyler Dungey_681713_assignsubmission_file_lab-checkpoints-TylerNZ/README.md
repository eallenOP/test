5 Instructions
Create a website that is a central repository for information about all kinds of recycling in Otago. At
a minimum the content of your site should answer the following questions:
• What recyclables go where?
• Where are the landfills, and what are their hours of operation?
• What should I do with my electronic waste?
• How can I be more environmentally friendly?
You can source this information from the internet and local council; it should be factual wherever
possible. The source of your information should be referenced in the footer of your page. The design
of your site should be user friendly, easy to navigate and professionally presented. Use an
appropriate colour scheme and design principles.
5.1 Minimum requirements

1. Minimum of five pages with consistent styling

2. Use HTML 5 and an external stylesheet with CSS

3. Contains at least one of each of the following:
 An HTML table containing tabular data
 A list or two
 A CSS grid
 A generated last modified date
 Minimum of three images

4. Must be menu-driven. All pages are to be linked to each other. The user should be able to
navigate to any page from any other page, no matter where the files are hosted (don’t hard
code the links to locations in your development environment as these will break when you
shift it to a deployment location).

5. Must contain links to recycling centres

6. Include a JavaScript recycling quiz. The quiz should use at least three kinds of form fields
and once submitted the user should receive feedback on which answers were correct and
which incorrect. Include a text field that takes the user’s name and make sure their name
appears in the feedback.

Extension for “bonus points”: allow the user to redo the quiz and provide both sets of feedback so
they can see if they improved.

If you’re not sure where to start, the following is a suggestion of how you might design the
information architecture:
